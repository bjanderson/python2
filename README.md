# Learn SQL

**Step 1**: make sure you have sqlite3 installed, and the SQLite extension installed in Visual Studio Code (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite).

**Step 2**: create a file named something like test-db.db in the python2 folder.

**Step 3**: In VS Code, Press CTRL+SHIFT+P to open the command prompt at the top. Type in sqlite, and choose Open Database. Then select the file you created - it will probably look like ./python2/test-db.db

**Step 4**: Open the user.sql file in the sql folder, right click on the text that starts with CREATE TABLE and select "Run Selected Query" from the menu.

**Step 5**: create a user and then select them from the database. You can also view the database by running it from the SQLITE Explorer in the bottom left corner of VS Code.

**Step 6**: read the docs to find out more about SQLITE - https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html

Have fun!
